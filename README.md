# Caesar-Cipher-algo
This code solves the Caesar Cipher problem by using a rotational cipher. It shifts letters by a set number of positions while keeping the case and non-alphabetic characters unchanged. The code treats uppercase and lowercase letters differently. It wraps around the alphabet with modulo 26 and keeps the original position of non-letter characters.
